# The Hangman Project

### This program should function as follows:


- Once ran, program will randomly choose a word from a list of predetermined words.

- The user will be prompted input their guesses of letters. The program will ensure the guess is a valid one.

- If all letters are guessed correctly, or if the user loses all their lives, the program will end.

### About Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

### Installation instructions

You can run the python files on any computer that has a python installed, no further packages are required.

You can run this through an IDE like IDLE/VSC or from the command line using:

> **python [filename].py**

in the directory of the file.


### What I learned during this project

Throughout this project I was able to improve my skills not only in python but also in the command line, conda and git. It also allowed me to understand control flows effectively.
